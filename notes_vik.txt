Everytime you build the project, the menuconfig settings reset.
To keep permanently the configurations made with 
idf.py menuconfig, save it and exit, AND THEN
idf.py save-defconfig.
This will place the genuine modifications you made into a 
sdkconfig.defaults, that the build process will use as an 
overlay.
